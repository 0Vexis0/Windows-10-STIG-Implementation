# STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides)

**STIGs** are configuration standards published by **DISA (Defense Information Systems Agency)** that define how information systems and software should be securely configured.

They provide detailed guidance for securing systems, covering settings such as:

- Operating system configurations
- Network and firewall rules
- Password policies and account management
- Security controls and auditing

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of STIGs is to reduce vulnerabilities, enforce compliance, and standardize security across systems, ensuring that systems are hardened against attacks and meet DoD or organizational cybersecurity requirements.

**Summary:**  
STIGs are official, prescriptive security baselines for configuring and maintaining secure systems.
